<a href="http://www.carminka.net">Carmin Karasic</a> One November morning in 1994, Carmin Karasic was listening to digital artists on NPR, when she realized she was a digital artist trapped in a Fidelity Technical Project Manager's body. This simple realization changed her life. So she traded the glory of Corporate America's high tech management for the personal satisfaction of creating digital art.
</p>
<p>
Carmin Karasic (USA) is a multimedia artist focused on information technology art. She has a BS in Mathematics/Computer Science, an MFA in visual arts, and many years experience in information technology as a software developer, project manager, and information architect. Currently she is living and working in Eindhoven, NL where she makes tech-based artworks, and she designs and teaches online technology courses for Lesley University, Cambridge, MA, USA. She has exhibited in North America, Europe, and Asia, and she is a founding member of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, the art activist group that created FloodNet and established electronic civil disobedience as a powerful mode of online mass protest, aka hacktivism. She is also the Education Consultant for Baltan Laboratories, an art and research lab, and the eLearning manager for Settels Savenije an engineering firm, both are in Eindhoven, NL. She has also been the Assistant Director of Boston Cyberarts, Boston, MA, USA, and Baltan Labs, and MAD Emergent Art Center, Eindhoven, NL.
</p>
<p>
Born April 9, 1954, in Shirley, Massachusetts, USA, she currently lives in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Carmin's <a href="http://www.carminka.net/"> website </a> her digital photo collage, web artworks, and summarized cyber-centric installation work. Her profession <a href="http://www.carminka.net/ckbio/ck_2page-resume2013-art.pdf"> resume</a> contains additional detail.

<p>
<a href="http://didyousayode.blogspot.co.uk/">Aude Charillon</a>. I grew up in France and studied librarianship there before moving to Newcastle. I have been working at Newcastle Libraries for the last 7 years and am currently the librarian for the Business & IP Centre. That means that on top of managing the business collection, organising and delivering events aimed at start-ups and established businesses, promoting the Centre and its services, I also advise customers on intellectual property - providing information about patents, designs, trademarks and copyright. 
</p>

<p>
I am fascinated by copyright which is why I am also developing at Newcastle Libraries a project called Commons are forever. The aim is to empower members of the public about their rights to use creative works - especially those that are in the public domain or published under open licenses. To help people discover those works, remix and share their own, I have been organising workshops with local artists, and more recently a photo competition based on the Wikimedia Foundation's Wiki Loves Monuments. I have also set up a LibraryBox at City Library (it's on but still under development!) for library customers to legally download curated content that they can in turn copy and share. 
</p>

<p>
As an information professional I am generally interested in the sharing of information, knowledge and culture - facilitating access to all this, but also making sure people know what they are doing when they are online or that they get a chance to understand what the talk of "digital" and "making" is all about.

<a href="https://www.hud.ac.uk/ourstaff/profile/index.php?staffuid=smusedd">Elizabeth Dobson</a> studied composition and music for media at Bangor University then retrained in social psychology of education and collaborative creativity with Open University. Now a senior lecturer in computer music composition at The University of Huddersfield she develops her work on collaborative creating within and beyond the music technology curriculum.  
</p>
<p>
Over the years she has collaborated with dancers and film makers, building a portfolio of experiences as a practitioner, though now as an educational psychologist she is committing time to social enterprise development for learning in music.   
</p>
<p>
She set up CollabHub, which is a social enterprise that fosters multi-disciplinary collaboration, and most recently her attention has turned to providing pathways for girls and women to develop skills in music technology.   
</p>
<p>
In 2015 she began an ethnography of Berlin based women working with technology for music and sound, initiated the EQ Network and then launched the Yorkshire Sound Women Network, which provides regular access and learning opportunities for girls and women interested in music and sound technology. Her practice is in computer based sound design and composition for images

<p>
<a href="https://www.rewritingthehack.github.io">Lindsay Duncanson</a> Having trained in photography video and digital imaging, I have worked as an artist for over fifteen years. My recent preoccupations have been with exploring landscape, energy and family. My work has a strong element of community and participation and from this root set up noizechoir an experimental vocal sound group which has performed across the U.K. and Europe. In practice this often involves returning to familiar locations to record, collect and make my work, finding ways to illuminate, animate and reinterpret space employing photography, video projection, text, illustration embroidery and sound.

<a href="https://theadventurousethnographer.wordpress.com/">Eve Forrest</a> is a Research Fellow at Edinburgh Napier University. Her research interests include embodied photography, media routines and phenomenology and specifically how these strands interweave   within   everyday   image   making   practices.   Her   doctoral   thesis (University   of Sunderland)    focused    upon    online    and    offline    photography    practices,    and    followed photographers  around  the  cities  of  Newcastle  and  Sunderland,  as  well  as on  Flickr.  She  is particularly  interested  in  how  the  body  and  technology  are  connected,  and  the  more  sensory aspects of everyday media use. Her current project at ENU, funded by the AHRC, focuses on the verbal  and  textual  rather  than  the  visual.  It  concentrates  on  opinion-making  and  expertise online  and  how  it  is  dispersed  through  various  textual  and  verbal  forms  via  blogging,  vlogging and  other  modes.    Eve  is  an  experienced  ethnographer  and  has  spoken  to a  wide  spectrum  of people  as  part  of  her  fieldwork  be  that  photographers,  sports  writers,  scientists  or  political pundits.  She  blogs  about  her  personal  experiences  and  world  travels  as  The  Adventurous Ethnographer.

<p>
<a href="https://nolinkprovided.com/">Diana Nowacka</a> . I am currently a PhD student at Open Lab, Newcastle University under the supervision of David Kirk. My main interests lie in creating new interfaces and exploring modern technologies suchas interactive surfaces, embedded sensors and actuators. My current research focusses on Tangible (Physical) User Interfaces, e.g. interfaces which let people interact with digital information through the physical environment. Particularly, I am exploring how autonomous behaviour could be implemented in these interfaces as autonomy proved to be a very fascinating property in interfaces. I try to achieve this by prototypinginteractive objects that show signs of autonomy and through qualitative analysis I hope to gain a closer understanding of humans perceptions of these. At the moment, I particularly enjoy prototyping with arduino and laser cutting. Previously, in 2010 I finished my B.Sc. in IT - Systems Engineering at University of Wuppertal in Germany and decided to change directions, towards Computing Science and Human-Computer Interaction. I therefore started my Masters in Applied Computing Science at University Duisburg-Essen. I finished my Masters during an internship at Open Lab (Culture Lab back then), where I worked on the detection of active objects on Multi-Touch Tables. In September 2012 I registered as full-time PhD student at Newcastle University with the outline to explore autonomous behaviour in Tangible User Interfaces.

<a href="http://www.jennypickett.co.uk">Jenny Pickett's</a> practice crosses: sculpture, sound, drawing, video, interactivity and performance. This plurality of mediums accumulate layers of meaning, in which Jenny Pickett often explores her subject through the influences of sound upon the gaze and visa versa, by poetically altering the sonic and visual counterparts asking the veiwer rethink their encounter with the works. Jenny Pickett also performs with electronics, prepared guitar and percussion in the projects "Cellule de Bass" and "Solar Return" and is a member of ORGONE (contemporary percussion group) and ONsemble (contemporary musique ensemble). 
</p>
<p>
Jenny Pickett is a member and collaborator with the artists' collective and cultural project: APO33, and realised various collective works both in contemporary music and visual arts including; GIASO : Great International Streaming Orchestra, Chaoslab and BOT project. Jenny Pickett has established and coordinated cross-border collaborations with other artist-run organisations. This has recently led to European grants being awarded to Opensound – a partnership project between 7 countries including UK, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Norway and We Have a Situation… with partners in Austria, Germany, France, The Netherlands, and the UK. Jenny Pickett holds a BA Honours in Fine Art from Falmouth College of Art, Cornwall and an MA in Interactive media: Critical theory and practice from Goldsmiths, University of London, she has co-authored articles published by Errant Bodies and IG Kultur Steiermark and has work included in the book Beyond Contemporary Art - by Etan Ilfeld (Vivays Publishing Ltd).

<p>
<a href="http:/www.ideasforchangeconsulting.co.uk">Sanjee Ratnatunga</a> is an economist and economic development practitioner living and working in the North East of England.   She has over twenty years of experience working for both local and regional government in various management roles contributing to the design and development of enterprise, business support and skills programmes. She has a particular interest in support provision for start-ups and small and medium sized businesses and has expertise in encouraging and developing collaborative ways of working for SMEs.  She has actively sought to design and develop programmes that encourage more women to access business support exploring what switches people off from mainstream provision.  This led her to explore market segmentation for enterprise support and the use of "hooks" to engage people. This work inspired her to undertake an MA in gender studies.. 
</p>
<p>
Through her work, Sanjee has developed a strong understanding of the key economic challenges and opportunities that face the region but is sometimes frustrated with the seeming reluctance of organisations to try alternative approaches to addressing these challenges!
</p>
<p>
In 2011, Sanjee set up her own business Ideas for Change Consulting, with a focus on supporting organisations to explore fresh thinking and new approaches to understanding persistent economic challenge. Sanjee works with businesses, charities, colleges and universities supporting them in achieving their goals.

<a href="http://chez.io">Francesca Sargent</a> I am a programming enthusiast and researcher from the seaside. I am also part of FoAM kernow, enjoying projects that form links between arts and the sciences, amongst other things - recently, I have been doing work for research projects at the University of Exeter, as well as making a website for the Bicrophonics Institute and dipping my toe into the world of tangible interfaces as part of a residency at Newlyn and The Exchange galleries in Cornwall. I love hacking things together and working with data, both collecting it, visualising it and distributing it in different ways, as well as considering representation of biological phenomenons such as flavour as data too. This year, I graduated from Falmouth University with a degree in Digital Media, and I plan to spend my time meeting wonderful people doing wonderful things.
